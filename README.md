# EDB extension data extraction

This folder contains all the data and scripts necessary for extracting the EDB extension dataset. For more information on the EDB extension dataset see the [WTO working paper](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/ersd202203_e.pdf). The latest extracted data can be downloaded at the following [data page](https://fbellelli.com/EDB-data.html).


# How to run the code:

For a correct execution of the scripts, make sure you do not change the file placements and their names.

2) Download the latest EDB version as a CSV from [https://edb.wto.org/search](https://edb.wto.org/search)

3) Place the new file in the folder "EDB raw data"

4) Open the script "EDB data extraction.R" and run it
